# Description

This page demonstrates a curved div, through stripes on a page. It also demonstrates reduce, which (unlike map) doesn't seem to be that well documented w examples, outside of the "sum a number" use case.

# Improvements

I thought about having the colors cycle through various choices, but it's really not that different from reloading, as shown here. In a real app, you could have it cycle through some extremely close color shades for a kind of glimmer effect.
